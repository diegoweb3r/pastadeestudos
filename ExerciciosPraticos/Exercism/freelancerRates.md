### Instructions

<p align="justify">

In this exercise you will be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with their clients about the prices of certain projects. You will write a few utility functions to quickly calculate the costs for the clients.

</p>

#### Numbers

<p align="justify">

Many programming languages have specific numeric types to represent different types of numbers, but JavaScript only has two:

* `number`: a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754). Examples are `-6`, `-2.4`, `0`, `0.1`, `1`, `3.14`, `16.984025`, `25`, `976`, `1024.0` and `500000`.
* `bigint`: a numeric data type that can represent *integers* in the arbitrary precision format. Examples are `-12n`, `0n`, `4n`, and `9007199254740991n`.

If you require arbitrary precision or work with extremely large numbers, use the `bigint` type. Otherwise, the `number` type is likely the better option.

</p>

#### Rounding

<p align="justify">

There is a built-in global object called `Math` that provides various [**rounding functions**](https://javascript.info/number#rounding). For example, you can round down (`floor`) or round up (`ceil`) decimal numbers to the nearest whole numbers.

</p>

```javascript
Math.floor(234.34); // => 234
Math.ceil(234.34); // => 235
```

#### Arithmetic Operators

<p align="justify">

JavaScript provides 6 different operators to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.

</p>

* `+`: The addition operator is used to find the sum of numbers.
* `-`: The subtraction operator is used to find the difference between two numbers.
* `*`: The multiplication operator is used to find the product of two numbers.
* `/`: The division operator is used to divide two numbers.

```javascript
2 - 1.5; //=> 0.5
19 / 2; //=> 9.5
```

* `%`: The remainder operator is used to find the remainder of a division performed.

```javascript
40 % 4; // => 0
-11 % 4; // => -3
```

* `**`: The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.

```javascript
4 ** 3; // => 64
4 ** 1 / 2; // => 2
```

#### Order of Operations

<p align="justify">

When using multiple operators in a line, JavaScript follows an order of precedence as shown in [**this precedence table**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table). To simplify it to our context, JavaScript uses the PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) rule we've learnt in elementary math classes.

</p>

```javascript
const result = 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4 / (3 - 1);
// => 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4/2
// => 27 + 9 * 4/2
// => 27 + 18
// => 45
```

#### Shorthand Assignment Operators

<p align="justify">

Shorthand assignment operators are a shorter way of writing code conducting arithmetic operations on a variable, and assigning the new value to the same variable. For example, consider two variables `x` and `y`. Then, `x += y` is same as `x = x + y`. Often, this is used with a number instead of a variable `y`. The 5 other operations can also be conducted in a similar style.

</p>

```javascript
let x = 5;
x += 25; // x is now 30

let y = 31;
y %= 3; // y is now 1
```

#### Task 1 - Calculate the day rate

<p align="justify">

The `ratePerHour` variable and the `dayRate` function are related to money. The units of measurement are money for a unit of time: hours and days respectively.

A client contacts the freelancer to enquire about their rates. The freelancer explains that they ***work 8 hours a day.*** However, the freelancer knows only their hourly rates for the project. Help them estimate a day rate given an hourly rate.

</p>

```javascript
dayRate(89);
// => 712
```

<p align="justify">

The day rate does not need to be rounded or changed to a "fixed" precision.

</p>

#### Task 2 - Calculate the number of days in the budget

<p align="justify">

Another day, a project manager offers the freelancer to work on a project with a fixed budget. Given the fixed budget and the freelancer's hourly rate, help them calculate the number of days they would work until the budget is exhausted. The result *must* be **rounded down** to the nearest whole number.

</p>

```javascript
daysInBudget(20000, 89);
// => 28
```

#### Task 3 - Calculate the price with a monthly discount

<p align="justify">

Often, the freelancer's clients hire them for projects spanning over multiple months. In these cases, the freelancer decides to offer a discount for every full month, and the remaining days are billed at day rate. Your excellent work-life balance means that you only work 22 days in each calendar month, so ***every month has 22 billable days.*** Help them estimate their cost for such projects, given an hourly rate, the number of billable days the project contains, and a monthly discount rate. The discount is always passed as a number, where `42%` becomes `0.42`. The result *must* be **rounded up** to the nearest whole number.

</p>

```javascript
priceWithMonthlyDiscount(89, 230, 0.42);
// => 97972
```

### Solução

```
export function dayRate(ratePerHour) {
  return ratePerHour * 8;
}

export function daysInBudget(budget, ratePerHour) {
  return Math.floor(budget/(ratePerHour*8));
}

export function priceWithMonthlyDiscount(ratePerHour, numDays, discount) {
   return Math.ceil(dayRate(ratePerHour) * ((Math.floor(numDays/22) * 22)) * (1 - discount) + dayRate(ratePerHour) * (numDays % 22));
}
```
